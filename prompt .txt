 THIS IS A PROMPT U USE BEFORE YOU ASK GPT FOR HELP SO THAT HE GETS THE CONTEXT



i have a project that includes building a desktop app for middle and high schools in algeria that generate automatically time tables , ive done this project before but it was in universitiy

but the thing is the data changes when it comes to high and middle schools the times are :

1st slot : 8-9
2nd slot : 9-10
3rd slot : 10-11
4th slot : 11-12
5th slot : 13h30 - 14h30
6th alot : 14h30 - 15h30 
7th slot : 15h30 - 16h30 

and for the things they study are diffrent too for middle schools they have 4 years from ( 1st years to 4th years) and they study:

-islamic coef 1
-arabic coef 5
-french coef 3
-english coef2
-math coef4
- history 
- and geographie
both are one module ( coef 3 ) 

- civil coef 1 
- sport coef 1 
- physics coef 2 
- science coef 2 

and for year there is more than 1 section , they are called M , for example 4M1 means the 1st M class in 4th year 

2M3 means the 3rd M class in 2nd years

for every year there is 3 M clsses , all the clssed in middle schools study the same 



now high school is a bit diffrent :

there are 3 years (1st , 2nd and 3rd ) 
1st yers are devided into ( scientifique , leterature ) and there is 5M for every one 
scientifique and leterature : math , arabic , french , english , science , physics , islamic , history and geography , sports 
the diff remains in theh coeff 


in their 2nd years students will pick their specialite 
scientifique can pick : matheleme ( 1 M) , math technique( 1 M)  , scientifique(3 M) , gestion (2 M)
leterature : forgein langauges (3 M ), philosophy (2 M)

and this will continue in their 3rd year 
there is no TD or TP , only cours (lectures)
